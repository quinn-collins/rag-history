# Introduction

- People typically treat AI as either a way to reproduce how the brain works or as a way to replicate things that historically have required humans to do. 
- Salesforce laid off 4000 people transitioning to AI-powered agents to handle customer interactions. Some reports suggested executive regret over overconfidence in LLM reliability.
- In the 1950s at a summer workshop at Darthmout, John McCarthy chose the name Artificial Intelligence. Norbert Wiener at the time was working with the name cybernetics.
- John McCarthy's focus was on symbolic reasoning and predicate logic.
  - If you start from a known premise and apply rules you can come toa conclusion and determine whether something is vald or not as a consequence. This is known as deductive reasoning.
  - Symbolic reasoning helped influence the expert systems of the 80s, the semantic web as a way of modeling domains and reasoning about them in the 90s and 2000s.
- Deductive reasoning isn't used to learn about the world its used to describe the world.
- Models won't predict things that it's never seen using inductive reasoning. 
- Induction process means that it can't be proven to be true and we need to consider it provisional until it is reinforced by our process of our understanding of the world.
- Our capacity for learning is not tied to complexity. Bumblebees can learn and have much smaller brains.
- We need new models that involve deductive, inductive, probablilistic reasoning to reach peoples expectations on AI so that it can learn as humans do.
- Abductive resoning how is this different or similar to things I've seen before.
- Ilya Sutzkever - The time for scale is over and the time of research is back.
